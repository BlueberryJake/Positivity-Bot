## Theme: Restoration
During the pandemic, we noticed that quarantine and uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 had a negative effect on people's mental health. Our project aims to help restore people's routines to how they were before COVID-19 and ease stresses that might have risen from the pandemic.

## What it does
This Discord bot keeps server members organized and in check with their mental health. Commands allows users to:
- Quickly access a list of helplines
- Set timers and add new ones
- Check your personal schedule and add new events
- Log your mood
- Monitor your Discord usage and average recent mood
- See a motivational quote
- See cute pet photos
- Read jokes
- Read some good news
- See food pictures
- See memes

## How we built it
The program was coded entirely in Python. We used the following libraries:
- os
- discord
- dotenv
- random
- requests
- json
- BeautifulSoup
